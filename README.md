# Bzip2 Archiver

Applications for archiving and dearchiving files.
This application uses Bzip2 algorithm and is based on the following algorithms:

* `BWT` (The Burrows-Wheeler Transform)
* `MTF` (Move-to-Front)
* `Huffman algorithm`

To demonstrate the actual compression ratio the first tome of `War and Piece` is included.
